        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="width: 40%;"> I am a recent graduate of Southern New Hampshire University with a BS in Computer Science, Software Engineering concentration.   
            I have studied Agile practices, SDLC, work documentation, Machine Learning, algorithms, data structures, databases, 
            embedded technologies, UI/UX, mobile development, Python, Java, C++, and MEAN stack development.  I enjoy learning new skills 
            and reading about emerging technologies.  The fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are particularly interesting
            to me, and I wonder often about the combination of these technologies with VR and AR to enhance the human experience.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            This project for CS-499 took a project from earlier coursework and added enhancements to demonstrate skills in Software Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
            The original work is taken from SNHU's CS-360, Mobile Architecture and Programming.  The CS-360 project was an Inventory App created in Android Studio for use on Android-powered
            mobile devices.  The Inventory App included a login screen, two database tables for users and items supported by SQLite, and a screen for editing the Item table.
        <h3>Software Engineering and Design Enhancement</h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            For the Software Engineering and Design enhancement, I decided to convert the mobile application into a full-stack application using the MEAN stack.

        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I added search and sort functionality for the Items table.  I also included cryptographic enhancements
            to provide authentication and authorization processes within the application.
        </p>
        <h3>Database Enhancement</h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            For the Databases enhancement, I implemented MongoDB to interact with the Software Design enhancement.  This enhancement partners with the
            Algorithms enhancement to use authentication before allowing access to the Items table.  The database allows CRUD functionality in the tables.
