    <section id="about">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="large-text"> My name is Kharl Newlander.  I joined Southern New Hampshire University in October of 2022 to work on a BS in Computer Science, Software Engineering concentration.  I have studied Agile practices, SDLC, work documentation, Machine Learning, algorithms, data structures, databases, embedded technologies, UI/UX, mobile development, Python, Java, C++, and MEAN stack development.  I enjoy learning new skills and reading about emerging technologies.  The fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are particularly interesting to me, and I wonder often about the combination of these technologies with VR and AR to enhance the human experience.</p>
        <p class="large-text"> Coursework in the program has exposed me to several technologies including Jupyter, PyCharm, VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Codio, JUnit, Github and others.  While taking CS-250 - Software Development Lifecycle - and CS-255 - System Analysis and Design - I learned about gathering user requirements, Agile development practices, and the importance of maintaining clear communication with stakeholders.  In CS-300 - Data Structures and Algorithms, Analysis and Design - I used C++ to explore sorting algorithms and data structures with a final project creating a management application for an animal rescue service.  DAD-220 - Introduction to Structured Databases - exposed me to MySql, CS-360 - Mobile Architecture & Programming - exposed me to SQLite, and CS-465 - Full-Stack Development - exposed me to MongoDB.  During all of my classes, discussion boards were used regularly to promote collaboration.  I have added many projects to repositories in Github which I look forward to enhancing and making public in the future.

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p class="large-text">
            The project for CS-499 took a project from earlier coursework and added enhancements to demonstrate skills in Software Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.  The original work is taken from SNHU's CS-360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming.  The CS-360 project was an Inventory App created in Android Studio for use on Android-powered mobile devices.  The Inventory App included a login screen, two database tables for users and items supported by SQLite, and a screen for editing the Item table. </p>

        <h3>Software Engineering and Design Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
           The original artifact for this enhancement came from CS-360 – Mobile Architecture and Programming.  This artifact was chosen because it offered the opportunity to convert a mobile application created in Android Studio into a full-stack application using the MEAN stack.
The enhancement in this narrative is the backend server application for the Inventory Management System.  This component was designed to serve as the core API for the frontend to retrieve, update, and manage inventory items.  It is an Express.js application built using Node.js, incorporating MongoDB for data storage and JWT for authentication.  The server is intended to provide a series of RESTful API endpoints to interact with data.  It was initially created for the first module of the course, but the current version reflects enhancements made throughout the course.  The wireframe visualization represents the current state of the planned frontend component, as of this module.  It shows the basic layout and components that will be used to interact with the server, and does not represent an application currently under development.

        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
            The process of enhancing and modifying the server taught me several valuable lessons:
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Importance of Planning: I learned that proper planning is key.  Before adding a feature, it's important to properly design it, understand the inputs and outputs, and the complexity of the task.  This makes the entire development process easier.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Value of Modularity: The improvements in modularity allowed the server to become better organized and maintainable, making it easier to expand with new features.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Balancing Functionality and Security: I saw that adding a new feature can create more security vulnerabilities if not properly designed with security in mind.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Debugging skills: It was key to understand how to use console logging and debugging to find bugs or problems.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Importance of Configuration: Understanding that configuration is key to managing complexity in applications by properly configuring secrets.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
                •	Iterative Process: Software development is truly an iterative process of build-test-improve.  The current version is not the final version, and it can always be improved upon further.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">
            The challenges I faced primarily related to handling complex queries, properly implementing security, and organizing code in a modular way.  However, these challenges helped me to grow as a developer.

        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
            The artifact selected for this enhancement again came from CS-360.  The core functionality target revolves around searching and filtering an inventory array, which uses foundational concepts in algorithms and data structures.  This artifact was chosen because it highlights the implementation of basic yet essential operations—linear search and string matching—within the context of real-world web applications.
        </p>
        <p class="large-text">The enhancement demonstrates the use of an array data structure and a linear search algorithm, both of which are fundamental in computer science.  Despite their simplicity, they form the basis of more advanced systems and optimizations.  The enhancements focus on improving search functionality and exploring potential optimizations for larger datasets.
        </p>
        <a href="inventory/inventory-list.component.ts" target="_blank">Enhancement 2</a>
        <h3>Database Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
            The artifact used for the Databases Enhancement was created in CS-360 – Mobile Architecture and Programming.  The Inventory App in the class used SQLite since the application was created in Android Studio.  This artifact was selected because in porting the original mobile application to a full-stack application, the database structure needs to be modified to MongoDB.  
The original work and the new version are similar in core functions, schema enforcement, connection management, and encapsulation.  The full-stack version uses a Mongoose schema to define the structure of the Item and User documents, rather than a relational database structure like SQL.  The MongoDB implementation also includes connection handling, retry logic, and graceful shutdown procedures which are more sophisticated than the SQLite implementation.  Both implementations encapsulate database access within a single class/module, promoting separation of concerns.         </p>
        <p class="large-text"> 
The database enhancements implemented through MongoDB and Mongoose created an environment that is more robust and flexible than the original.  MongoDB is used industry-wide for full-stack applications in the MEAN stack.  Declaring types and defaults in the documents provides a base layer of security for the database.  When paired with the Algorithms enhancement, the Database enhancement mitigates potential vulnerabilities using authentication, authorization, and password hashing.
