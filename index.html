        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="large-text"> My name is Kharl Newlander.  I joined Southern New Hampshire University in October of 2022 to work on a BS in Computer Science, Software Engineering concentration.  I have studied Agile practices, SDLC, work documentation, Machine Learning, algorithms, data structures, databases, embedded technologies, UI/UX, mobile development, Python, Java, C++, and MEAN stack development.  I enjoy learning new skills and reading about emerging technologies.  The fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are particularly interesting to me, and I wonder often about the combination of these technologies with VR and AR to enhance the human experience.</p>
        <p class="large-text"> Coursework in the program has exposed me to several technologies including Jupyter, PyCharm, VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Codio, JUnit, Github and others.  While taking CS-250 - Software Development Lifecycle - and CS-255 - System Analysis and Design - I learned about gathering user requirements, Agile development practices, and the importance of maintaining clear communication with stakeholders.  In CS-300 - Data Structures and Algorithms, Analysis and Design - I used C++ to explore sorting algorithms and data structures with a final project creating a management application for an animal rescue service.  DAD-220 - Introduction to Structured Databases - exposed me to MySql, CS-360 - Mobile Architecture & Programming - exposed me to SQLite, and CS-465 - Full-Stack Development - exposed me to MongoDB.  During all of my classes, discussion boards were used regularly to promote collaboration.  I have added many projects to repositories in Github which I look forward to enhancing and making public in the future.

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p class="large-text">
            The project for CS-499 took a project from earlier coursework and added enhancements to demonstrate skills in Software Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.  The original work is taken from SNHU's CS-360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming.  The CS-360 project was an Inventory App created in Android Studio for use on Android-powered mobile devices.  The Inventory App included a login screen, two database tables for users and items supported by SQLite, and a screen for editing the Item table. </p>

        <h3>Software Engineering and Design Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
            For the Software Engineering and Design enhancement, I decided to convert the mobile application into a full-stack application using the MEAN stack.  Because the original work was done in Android Studio and the enhancement used the MEAN stack, there were several considerations to keep in mind, such as structure, functionality, and naming conventions.

        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
            For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I added search and sort functionality for the Items table.  I also included cryptographic enhancements to provide authentication and authorization processes within the application.
        </p>
        <h3>Database Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="large-text">
            The artifact used for the Databases Enhancement was created in CS-360 â€“ Mobile Architecture and Programming.  The Inventory App in the class used SQLite since the application was created in Android Studio.  This artifact was selected because in porting the original mobile application to a full-stack application, the database structure needs to be modified to MongoDB.  
The original work and the new version are similar in core functions, schema enforcement, connection management, and encapsulation.  The full-stack version uses a Mongoose schema to define the structure of the Item and User documents, rather than a relational database structure like SQL.  The MongoDB implementation also includes connection handling, retry logic, and graceful shutdown procedures which are more sophisticated than the SQLite implementation.  Both implementations encapsulate database access within a single class/module, promoting separation of concerns.  
The database enhancements implemented through MongoDB and Mongoose created an environment that is more robust and flexible than the original.  MongoDB is used industry-wide for full-stack applications in the MEAN stack.  Declaring types and defaults in the documents provides a base layer of security for the database.  When paired with the Algorithms enhancement, the Database enhancement mitigates potential vulnerabilities using authentication, authorization, and password hashing.
